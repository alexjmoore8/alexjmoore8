# Greetings, I'm Alex!
    
## About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer who thrives at the intersection of AI, automation, and cloud infrastructure. With a Master’s in Computer Science and a JD in my back pocket, I bring a rare mix of technical depth and an eye for security and compliance. I enjoy building systems that are not just powerful, but practical—tools that actually make engineers' lives easier.

At Veradigm, I’ve led projects that embed generative AI into everyday workflows, like Slack and Jira chatbots thanks to vector search, reranking, and custom knowledge bases. I’ve also rolled out secure Terraform deployments using GitHub OIDC, built scalable pipelines with ArgoCD and EKS, and made “infrastructure as code” feel a lot less painful.

What drives me? Taking messy, manual processes and turning them into clean, automated solutions that scale. I care about building things the right way: with strong security, clear architecture, and just the right amount of automation.

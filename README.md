# Greetings, I'm Alex!
    
## About Me

I am a computer science master's student finishing up my degree in December 2023.  I am currently working as a DevOps Engineer. My most recent projects include automating different CI/CD steps with Github Actions. The technologies I use daily in this are Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions, and Bash. I also have experience coding in Python, Java, and Node JS. I enjoy digging in to complex projects and delivering well organized, robust functionality.
